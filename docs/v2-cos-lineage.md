# V2 COS lineage

This note explains the V2 COS attempt now stored in this repository.

## Repository paths

- `experiments/v2/spec-v2/`: neutral OS capability and chapter specs.
- `experiments/v2/bundles/`: chapter bundles used by the V2 generation run.
- `experiments/v2/cos/ch2` through `ch8`: accepted COS chapter snapshots.
- `experiments/v2/user/`: shared user-space test sources used as build inputs.
- `experiments/v2/tg-rcore-tutorial-{console,signal-defs,syscall}/`: small support crates required by the user tests.

## What V2 is

V2 is a compact, per-chapter C OS generation attempt. Each chapter is an
independent QEMU/RISC-V teaching OS snapshot with `src/main.c`, `src/entry.S`,
`scripts/build_apps.sh`, `Makefile`, `linker.ld`, `test.sh`, and an acceptance
`report.md`.

V2 is not the same artifact as the polished Phase C line in
`trial-workspaces/chX/workspace/c-port/` and `deliverables/chapters/chX/`. The
main Phase C workspace keeps cleaned bundles, CMake build structure, runtime
assets, exported binaries, and the verification CLI. V2 is included as a
historical consistency artifact showing that the same neutral spec and bundle
set can drive a compact C implementation through the common base tests.

## Scope

The V2 matrix proves only the accepted base user-visible behavior. It does not
claim full equivalence with tg-rcore, Phase C's polished CMake workspace,
exercise tests, negative paths, or all robustness properties.
